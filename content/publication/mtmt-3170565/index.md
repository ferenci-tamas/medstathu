abstract: Objectives We aimed to describe the procedural characteristics and 5-year
  outcome of consecutive patients undergoing unprotected left main coronary artery
  (ULMCA) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at our tertiary care centre between
  1 January 2007 and 31 December 2008. Methods and results 76 patients underwent ULMCA
  PCI during the study period. Drug-eluting stents were used in 61. The mean EuroSCORE
  II, additive and logistic EuroSCOREs and SYNTAX score were 14.81, 10.2, 25.25 and
  27.3, respectively. 30-day and 5-year mortality were 14.5% and 50%, respectively,
  with early mortality related exclusively to circulatory causes and late mortality
  being non-cardiac in 74%. Clinical presentation was a key determinant of 5-year
  mortality. During follow-up 1 patient suffered a non-fatal myocardial infarction
  (MI) related to ULMCA in-stent restenosis (ISR), 2 others suffered MI related to
  non-ULMCA lesions. Definite and probable stent thrombosis occurred in 1 (non-ULMCA
  stent) and 1, respectively. 3 patients had ULMCA ISR, 14 had non-ULMCA ISR necessitating
  redo revascularisation. Conclusions ULMCA PCI is a good treatment modality in patients
  who cannot undergo CABG. Clinical presentation and downstream disease have a major
  influence on the 5-year outcome. © 2016, Acta Cardiologica. All rights reserved.
