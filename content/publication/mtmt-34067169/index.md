abstract: Background. Although the importance of social media platforms in people’s
  daily lives and their role in advertisement, and the persistent increase in online
  gambling participation over the years are unquestioned, no study has examined how
  the unavailability of social media affects online gambling. A 6-hour-long worldwide
  outage of Facebook on 4th October 2021 created a unique possibility to investigate
  this relationship. Objectives. The aim of the present study was to examine whether
  online gambling behaviour during the Facebook outage was different from gambling
  patterns on other Monday evenings. Methods. We analysed behavioural tracking data
  from an online gambling service provider, Fortuna Entertainment Group (FEG). The
  datasets included information on the gambling patterns of 232,037 players from five
  different countries (Croatia, Czechia, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia) on five consecutive
  Mondays, including the day of the Facebook outage. A linear regression was estimated
  for several outcome variables (number of players, amount of stake, number of bets)
  separately for each country and gaming and sports betting type of gambling, while
  gender, age, time, and date were included as control variables. Results. Most of
  the ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions showed a non-significant impact of
  the outage, and only a few significant, but small differences were identified. In
  these cases, the outage was associated with a lower outcome. Conclusion. In the
  case of the examined countries, the Facebook outage only had a marginal impact on
  gambling behaviour. Further research and analysis are needed to explore the connection
  between social media use and abstinence and gambling.
