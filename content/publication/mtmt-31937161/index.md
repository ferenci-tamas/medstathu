abstract: Describe the characteristics, management and outcomes of hospitalized ST-segment
  elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients according to national ongoing myocardial
  infarction registries in Estonia, Hungary, Norway, and Sweden.Country-level aggregated
  data was used to study baseline characteristics, use of in-hospital procedures,
  medications at discharge, in-hospital complications, 30-day and 1-year mortality
  for all patients admitted with STEMI during 2014–2017 using data from EMIR (Estonia;
  n = 4584), HUMIR (Hungary; n = 23 685), NORMI (Norway; n = 12 414, data for 2013–2016),
  and SWEDEHEART (Sweden; n = 23 342). Estonia and Hungary had a higher proportion
  of women, patients with hypertension, diabetes, and peripheral artery disease compared
  to Norway and Sweden. Rates of reperfusion varied from 75.7% in Estonia to 84.0%
  in Sweden. Rates of recommendation of discharge medications were generally high
  and similar. However, Estonia demonstrated the lowest rates of dual antiplatelet
  therapy (78.1%) and statins (86.5%). Norway had the lowest rates of beta-blockers
  (80.5%) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers
  (61.5%). The 30-day mortality rates ranged between 9.9% and 13.4% remaining lowest
  in Sweden. One-year mortality rates ranged from 14.8% in Sweden and 16.0% in Norway
  to 20.6% in Hungary and 21.1% in Estonia. Age-adjusted lethality rates were highest
  for Hungary and lowest for Sweden.This inter-country comparison of data from four
  national ongoing European registries provides new insights into the risk factors,
  management and outcomes of patients with STEMI. There are several possible reasons
  for the findings, including coverage of the registries and variability of baseline-characteristics’
  definitions that need to be further explored.
