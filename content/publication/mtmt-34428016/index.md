abstract: 'Background: Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a leading cause of
  death and retransplantation following heart transplantation (HTX). Surveillance
  angiography performed yearly is indicated for the early detection of the disease,
  but it remains of limited sensitivity. Methods: We performed bolus thermodilution-based
  coronary flow reserve (CFR) and index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) and fractional
  flow reserve (FFR) measurements in HTX patients undergoing yearly surveillance coronary
  angiography without overt CAV. Results: In total, 27 HTX patients were included
  who had 52 CFR, IMR, and FFR measurements at a mean of 43 months after HTX. Only
  five measurements were performed in the first year. CFR decreased significantly
  by 0.13 every year (p = 0.04) and IMR tended to increase by 0.98 every year (p =
  0.051), whereas FFR did not change (p = 0.161) and remained well above 0.80 over
  time. After one year, CFR decreased significantly (p = 0.022) and IMR increased
  significantly (p = 0.015), whereas FFR remained unchanged (p = 0.72). Conclusions:
  The functional status of the epicardial coronary arteries of transplanted hearts
  did not deteriorate over time. On the contrary, a significant decrease in CFR was
  noted. In view of the increasing IMR, this is caused by the deterioration of the
  function of microvasculature. CFR and IMR measurements may provide an early opportunity
  to diagnose CAV.'
