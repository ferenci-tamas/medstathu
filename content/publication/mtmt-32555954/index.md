abstract: 'Objective:Characterizing blood glucose curves and providing precise patient
  level risk assessment of hyperglycemia using extreme value statistics and comparing
  these assessments with traditional indicators of glycemic variability which are
  not designed to specifically capture the risk of hyperglycemia.Research Design and
  Methods:One year return level (blood glucose level exceeded exactly once every year
  on average) and probability of exceeding and expected time spent above certain thresholds
  (600 and 400 mg/dL) per year were calculated. As a comparison, traditional metrics
  for glycemic variability were determined too. The effect of body mass index on extremes
  was also investigated using non-stationary models. Metrics were calculated on a
  dataset containing 170.8 patient-years of measurements of 226 patients.Results:Nine
  high-risk patients were identified with the novel metrics: their estimated time
  spent above 600 mg/dL per year were above 2 hours. These patients were at moderate
  risk according to the traditional metrics. Higher body mass index was associated
  with more extreme glucose levels.Conclusions:Through these estimates it is possible
  to assess each patient?s individual clinical risk of hyperglycemia even beyond the
  observed blood glucose levels and detection limits. Additionally, it allows the
  assessment of the impact of clinical characteristics and treatments on blood glucose
  control in a novel, mathematically well-founded and potentially clinically more
  useful way than the already existing indicators.'
