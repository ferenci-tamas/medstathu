abstract: "INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The aim was to study the patients' adherence to some\
  \ evidence-based medication (statins, beta blockers, platelet and RAS inhibitors)\
  \ after suffering a myocardial infarction, and its impact on the outcome. METHOD:\
  \ Retrospective observational cohort study was carried out from the data of the\
  \ Hungarian Myocardial Infarction Registry between January 1, 2013, and December\
  \ 31, 2014. 14,843 patients were alive at the end of hospital treatment, from them,\
  \ those who had no myocardial infarction or death until 180 days were followed for\
  \ one year. The adherence was defined as the proportion of time from the index event\
  \ to the endpoint (or censoring) covered with prescription fillings. The endpoint\
  \ was defined as death or reinfarction. Information on filling prescriptions for\
  \ statins, platelet aggregation inhibitors, beta blockers and ARB/ACEI-inhibitors\
  \ were obtained. Multivariate regression was used to model adherence and survival\
  \ time. RESULTS: Good adherence (>80%) to clopidogrel, statins, beta blockers, aspirin\
  \ and ARB/ACEI was found in 64.9%, 54.4%, 36.5%, 31.7% and 64.0%, respectively.\
  \ Patients treated with PCI during the index hospitalization had higher adherence\
  \ to all medication (all p<0.01), except for beta-blocker (p = 0.484). Multivariate\
  \ analysis confirmed that adherence to statins, to clopidogrel and ARB/ACEI-inhibitors\
  \ was associated with 10.1% (p<0.0001), 10.4% (p = 0.0002) and 15.8% (p<0.0001)\
  \ lower hazard of endpoint respectively for 25% points increase in adherence, controlling\
  \ for age, sex, performing of PCI, 5 anamnestic data and date of index event. Adherence\
  \ to aspirin and beta blockers was not significantly associated with the hazard.\
  \ CONCLUSION: Higher adherence to some evidence-based medications was found to be\
  \ associated with improved long term prognosis of the patients. Orv Hetil. 2017;\
  \ 158(27): 1051-1057."
