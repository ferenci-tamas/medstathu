abstract: 'Background: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening
  disease with risk stratification-based treatment strategy in adults. Although the
  risk factors have been studied individually in children, effective risk stratification
  is still lacking. We have tested the prognostic accuracy of pediatric PAH risk factors
  in our patient group. Patients and methods: Records of 58 PAH patients treated between
  1995 and 2019 were reviewed retrospectively. Median age at diagnosis was 4.2 years
  (range, 0.1-16.1 years), and follow-up was 5.4 years (range, 0.01-24.1 years). Data
  collected at diagnosis were demographics, World Health Organization functional class,
  evidence of right ventricular failure, and parameters of echocardiography and cardiac
  catheterization. Results: Mortality was 29% and 33% reached the composite endpoint.
  Patients with idiopathic PAH (n = 12) had increased risk of mortality compared with
  the congenital heart disease-associated PAH group (n = 32) (P = .0024). Neither
  the initial World Health Organization functional class staging nor the echocardiographic
  parameters significantly predicted the prognosis. The number of risk factors had
  no significant prognostic value either. In contrast, patients with higher pulmonary
  vascular resistance index (PVRI) had significantly increased risk (each 10 Wood
  units ⋅ m2 increase in PVRI being associated with 49.1% higher hazard, P = .0048).
  Conclusions: Survival analysis showed that PAH etiology might be an important determinant
  in pediatric PAH risk stratification. We confirmed that PVRI has predictive value
  in prognostic assessment. We could not establish the prognostic value of nonweighted
  single risk factors or their combination to predict pediatric PAH outcome due to
  the low sample size, but these results indicate that such studies are warranted.
