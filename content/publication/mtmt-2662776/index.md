abstract: Obesity is a rapidly spreading endemic in almost every country of the developed
  world. Due to its severe comorbidities, it represents large risk from the epidemiological
  point of view. Emphasis is on the early identification of risked individuals, which
  calls for effective screening methods. In this paper, we examine the possibilities
  of using laboratory parameters alone for the identification of manifestly obese
  children – such method can be later used to identify those who are not already obese,
  but are in risk, i.e. as a screening method. We primarily confine ourselves to univariate
  analysis, but will also show a multivariate example.
