abstract: "Introduction: This study examines the likelihood and evolution of overall
  and hypoglycemia-inducing variability of insulin sensitivity in ICU patients based
  on diagnosis and day of stay. Materials and Methods: An analysis of model-based
  insulin sensitivity for patients in a medical ICU (Christchurch, New Zealand). Two
  metrics are defined to measure the variability of a patient's insulin sensitivity
  relative to predictions of a stochastic model created from the same data for all
  patients over all days of stay. The first selectively captures large increases related
  to the risk of hypoglycemia. The second captures overall variability. Distributions
  of per-patient variability scores were evaluated over different ICU days of stay
  and for different diagnosis groups based on APACHE III: operative and non-operative
  cardiac, gastric, all other. Linear and generalized linear mixed effects models
  assess the statistical significance of differences between groups and over days.
  Results: Variability defined by the two metrics was not substantially different.
  Variability was highest on day 1, and decreased over time () in every diagnosis
  group. There were significant differences between some diagnosis groups: non-operative
  gastric patients were the least variable, while cardiac (operative and non-operative)
  patients exhibited the highest variability. Conclusions: This study characterizes
  the variability and evolution of insulin sensitivity in critically ill patients,
  and may help inform the clinical management of metabolic dysfunction in critical
  care."
