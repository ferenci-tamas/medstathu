abstract: "Introduction: This study examines the likelihood and evolution of overall\
  \ and hypoglycemia-inducing variability of insulin sensitivity in ICU patients based\
  \ on diagnosis and day of stay. Materials and Methods: An analysis of model-based\
  \ insulin sensitivity for patients in a medical ICU (Christchurch, New Zealand).\
  \ Two metrics are defined to measure the variability of a patient's insulin sensitivity\
  \ relative to predictions of a stochastic model created from the same data for all\
  \ patients over all days of stay. The first selectively captures large increases\
  \ related to the risk of hypoglycemia. The second captures overall variability.\
  \ Distributions of per-patient variability scores were evaluated over different\
  \ ICU days of stay and for different diagnosis groups based on APACHE III: operative\
  \ and non-operative cardiac, gastric, all other. Linear and generalized linear mixed\
  \ effects models assess the statistical significance of differences between groups\
  \ and over days. Results: Variability defined by the two metrics was not substantially\
  \ different. Variability was highest on day 1, and decreased over time () in every\
  \ diagnosis group. There were significant differences between some diagnosis groups:\
  \ non-operative gastric patients were the least variable, while cardiac (operative\
  \ and non-operative) patients exhibited the highest variability. Conclusions: This\
  \ study characterizes the variability and evolution of insulin sensitivity in critically\
  \ ill patients, and may help inform the clinical management of metabolic dysfunction\
  \ in critical care."
