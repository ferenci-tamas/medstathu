abstract: 'This systematic review aims to assess whether edible vegetable oils and
  fats fortified with vitamin A and/or D are effective and safe in improving vitamin
  intake and ameliorating deficiency states in the general population. In November
  2022, we systematically searched MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, Global Index
  Medicus, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP (International Clinical Trials Registry
  Platform) for randomized controlled trials (RCT) and non-randomized studies of interventions
  (NRSI) investigating the fortification of edible vegetable oils and fats with either
  vitamin A or vitamin D or both as compared to the same vegetable oils and/or fats
  without vitamin A and D fortification or no interventions, in the general population,
  without age restriction. We assessed the methodological quality of included RCTs
  using Cochrane’s risk of bias tool 2.0 and of NRSIs using ROBINS-I tool. We performed
  random-effects meta-analysis and assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE. We
  included eight studies. Available evidence showed no significant effect of fortification
  with vitamin A on serum retinol levels (RCTs: MD 0.35 µmol/L, 95% CI −0.43 to 1.12;
  two trials; 514 participants; low-certainty evidence; CCTs: MD 0.31 µmol/L, 95%
  CI −0.18 to 0.80; two trials; 205 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and
  on subclinical vitamin A deficiency. Low-certainty evidence showed no effect of
  vitamin D fortification on serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentration (MD 6.59 nmol/L,
  95% CI −6.89 to 20.07; one trial; 62 participants). In conclusion, vitamin A-fortified
  vegetable oils and fats may result in little to no difference in serum retinol levels
  in general populations. The dose of vitamin A used in the trials may be safe but
  may not be sufficient to reduce subclinical vitamin A deficiency. Further, the evidence
  suggests that vitamin D fortification results in little to no difference in serum
  25-hydroxy vitamin D concentration. Several aspects of providing fortified oils
  and fats to the general population as a public health intervention should be further
  investigated, including optimal fortification dose, effects on vitamin D deficiency
  and its clinical symptoms and potential adverse effects.'
