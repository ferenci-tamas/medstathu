abstract: In a recent systematic review, we investigated the medium- and long-term
  effects of non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) in people with diabetes mellitus. We included
  randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of four weeks or more comparing
  any type of NNS with usual diet, no intervention, placebo, water, a different NNS,
  or a nutritive sweetener in individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.
