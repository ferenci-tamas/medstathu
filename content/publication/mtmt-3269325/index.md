abstract: 'Background: CT-P13, the first biosimilar monoclonal antibody to infliximab
  (IFX), has been confirmed to be efficacious in inducing remission in inflammatory
  bowel diseases (IBD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy
  and safety of CT-P13 therapy in Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC),
  and to identify predictors of sustained clinical response during a 54-week CT-P13
  treatment period. Patients and methods: Patients with CD and UC, who were administered
  CT-P13, were prospectively enrolled. Clinical response was assessed at week 14 and
  week 54. Predictive factors for disease outcome at week 54 were evaluated. Results:
  57 CD and 57 UC patients were included; 55 CD and 49 UC patients completed the induction
  therapy and 50 CD and 46 UC patients completed the 54-week treatment period. Clinical
  remission was achieved in 65.5% of CD and 75.5% of UC patients at week 14. Rate
  of continuous clinical response was 51% in both CD and UC at week 54. None of the
  examined parameters were predictive to the clinical outcome neither in CD, nor in
  UC. Conclusion: This study confirmed the long-term efficacy and safety of CT-P13
  therapy in IBD. Response rates at week 54 were similar in CD and UC. © 2017 Informa
