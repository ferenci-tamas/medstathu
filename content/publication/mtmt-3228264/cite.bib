 abstract = {Infectious Hospital Agents (IHA) is an individual-based simulation framework that is able to model wide range of infection spreading scenarios in the hospital environment. The simulations are agent-based simulations driven by stochastic events, the evolution of the model is tracked in discrete time. Our aim was to build a general, customisable and extensible simulation environment for the domain of Hospital-Associated Infections (HAIs). The system is designed in Object Oriented fashion, and the implementation is in C++. In this paper, the authors describe the motivations and the background of the framework, sketch the conceptual framework, and present a demonstration example. © 2017, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.
