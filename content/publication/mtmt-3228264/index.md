abstract: Infectious Hospital Agents (IHA) is an individual-based simulation framework
  that is able to model wide range of infection spreading scenarios in the hospital
  environment. The simulations are agent-based simulations driven by stochastic events,
  the evolution of the model is tracked in discrete time. Our aim was to build a general,
  customisable and extensible simulation environment for the domain of Hospital-Associated
  Infections (HAIs). The system is designed in Object Oriented fashion, and the implementation
  is in C++. In this paper, the authors describe the motivations and the background
  of the framework, sketch the conceptual framework, and present a demonstration example.
