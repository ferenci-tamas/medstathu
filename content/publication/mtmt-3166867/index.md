abstract: Antiangiogenic inhibitors offer a promising new treatment modality in oncology.
  However, the optimal administration regime is often not well-established, despite
  the fact that it might have substantial impact on the outcome. The aim of the present
  study was to investigate this issue. Eight weeks old male C57Bl/6 mice were implanted
  with C38 colon adenocarcinoma, and were given either daily (n = 9) or single (n
  = 5) dose of bevacizumab; both receiving the same dose the only difference being
  the administration pattern. Outcome was measured by tracking tumor volume; both
  caliper and magnetic resonance imaging was employed. Longitudinal growth curves
  were modelled with mixed-effects models (with correction for autocorrelation and
  heteroscedasticity, where necessary) to infer on population-level. Several different
  growth models (exponential, logistic, Gompertz) were applied and compared. Results
  show that the estimation of the exponential model is very reliable, but it prevents
  extrapolation in time. Nevertheless, it clearly stablished the advantage of the
  continuous regime.
