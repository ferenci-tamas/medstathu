abstract: 'Background: The authors analyzed data from the Hungarian Myocardial Infarction
  Registry (HUMIR) to examine the potential impact of gender on the treatment and
  30-day and 1-year mortality of patients with myocardial infarction (MI). Materials
  and Methods: The National Registry of Myocardial Infarction included 42,953 patients
  between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2016; 19,875 of whom were diagnosed with
  ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and 23,078 with non-ST-elevation myocardial
  infarction (NSTEMI). The proportion of women was 39% and 41.9% in the two groups,
  respectively. Logistic regression analysis was performed adjusting for age, the
  year and month of hospital admission, smoking, as well as for five concomitant diseases
  and anamnestic data. We found that the odds ratio (OR) of performing percutaneous
  coronary intervention (PCI) was influenced by age, the year of treatment, prior
  stroke, and peripheral artery disease (PAD) in both patient groups. Results: Gender
  had an impact on treatment in both cases; women had significantly fewer PCIs (OR
  = 0.86 confidence interval [95% CI: 0.77-0.95] in the STEMI group, OR = 0.75 [95%
  CI: 0.70-0.82] in the NSTEMI group). Age and PCI, PAD, and diabetes mellitus proved
  to be prognostic factors for 30-day and 1-year mortality in both groups. In the
  STEMI group, hypertension proved to be of prognostic value for both 30-day and 1-year
  mortality, whereas prior MI, stroke, and smoking only affected 1-year mortality.
  Similarly, in the NSTEMI group, prior stroke was also of prognostic value for 30-day
  and 1-year mortality, whereas prior MI, hypertension and smoking were only associated
  with 1-year mortality. Conclusions: The independent prognostic value of gender could
  not be proven for any of the MI types or follow-up periods. In conclusion, gender
  influenced the treatment of patients with MI but had no significant impact on prognosis
  in itself.'
