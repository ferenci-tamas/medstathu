 abstract = {Introduction: It is well-known that obesity has a marked effect on many of the routinely measured laboratory parameters. An obvious example is the serum level of various blood lipids: hyperlipidemia, hypercholesteremia are often observed in obese people. Our research aims to provide a more thorough understanding of the effects of obesity on laboratory parameters, concentrating on every laboratory parameter (not just those that are already established as being related to obesity) and their correlational structure. We focus on adolescent population, as they are the most important from the public health point of view. Material and methods: A cross-sectional clinical study was performed that included the observation of n=163 male children (aged 14-18), consisting of healthy volunteers from Hungarian secondary schools and obese patients treated with E66.9 “Obesity, unspecified” diagnosis (ICD-10). The observation included the recording of 33 laboratory parameters from blood sample. To explore this database, we performed Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (FA) to ease the understanding on correlations of the laboratory parameters by identifying those groups of variables that have strong stochastic connection. Such connections between laboratory parameters were further analyzed by Cluster Analysis (CA). Results: The applied methods all reveal similar patterns of association between different laboratory parameters. Variables that are found to be stochastically connected, also share physiologic similarities. The effects of obesity can also be exposed. Conclusion: Stochastically connected laboratory parameters – with different physiological interpretation – can be in fact statistically identified and used to draw conclusions about the multivariate structure of laboratory results.},
