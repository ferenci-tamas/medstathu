abstract: 'Introduction: It is well-known that obesity has a marked effect on many
  of the routinely measured laboratory parameters. An obvious example is the serum
  level of various blood lipids: hyperlipidemia, hypercholesteremia are often observed
  in obese people. Our research aims to provide a more thorough understanding of the
  effects of obesity on laboratory parameters, concentrating on every laboratory parameter
  (not just those that are already established as being related to obesity) and their
  correlational structure. We focus on adolescent population, as they are the most
  important from the public health point of view. Material and methods: A cross-sectional
  clinical study was performed that included the observation of n=163 male children
  (aged 14-18), consisting of healthy volunteers from Hungarian secondary schools
  and obese patients treated with E66.9 “Obesity, unspecified” diagnosis (ICD-10).
  The observation included the recording of 33 laboratory parameters from blood sample.
  To explore this database, we performed Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Factor
  Analysis (FA) to ease the understanding on correlations of the laboratory parameters
  by identifying those groups of variables that have strong stochastic connection.
  Such connections between laboratory parameters were further analyzed by Cluster
  Analysis (CA). Results: The applied methods all reveal similar patterns of association
  between different laboratory parameters. Variables that are found to be stochastically
  connected, also share physiologic similarities. The effects of obesity can also
  be exposed. Conclusion: Stochastically connected laboratory parameters – with different
  physiological interpretation – can be in fact statistically identified and used
  to draw conclusions about the multivariate structure of laboratory results.'
