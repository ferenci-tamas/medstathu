abstract: 'Despite the adequate antibiotic prophylaxis, the incidence and mortality
  rate of infective endocarditis (IE) is still high. In the past few decades, several
  studies have noted an increase in the proportion of IE caused by staphylococcal
  species.The aim of our retrospective study was to assess the clinical and microbiological
  characteristics, trends, and the 1, 6 and 12-month cardiovascular (CV) mortality
  rate of patients administered for IE in our tertiary hospital between January 1,
  2006 and December 31, 2016.We identified 465 cases (311 men, 154 women) of 448 patients,
  mean age was 56,1 ± 16,4 years (14-92). Native left-sided IE (NLIE) was assessed
  in 286 cases (61,5%, mitral in 117, aorta in 116, combined in 53 cases), prosthetic
  valve IE (PVIE) was in 111 cases (24%, early in 44, late in 67), right-sided IE
  (RIE) in 12 cases (2,5%), cardiac device related IE (CDRIE) in 50 cases (11%), other
  in 6 cases (1%). The underlying infection was caused by streptococci in 124 cases
  (27%), Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in 112 cases (24%, out of them 23 had MRSA), coagulase
  negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) in 39 cases (8%), enterococci in 75 cases (16%).
  Blood culture negative cases found in 61 patients (13%), in 38 cases (8%) other,
  diversified germs and in 16 cases (4%) there were no data on the pathogen agent.
  one-month was 12.8%, six-month was 26.4%, one-year was 29.7%, and five-year was
  40%. There was a significant difference in the mortality rate regarding both of
  the type of IE and in terms of the underlying microorganism (log-rank p = 0.03 and
  p = 0.04 resp). The worst survival rate was detected among patients with PVIE, and
  patients with staphylococcal infection, especially with MRSA. Cox regression found
  that age (HR: 1.4; CI:1.3-1.6; p <0.001), ejection fraction (HR: 1.4; CI:1.2-1.5;
  p <0.001), hemoglobin and creatinin levels (HR: 0.9; CI:0.8-0.97 p = 0.01; HR: 1.3;
  CI: 1.1-1.5; p = 0.001 resp.), MRSA compared to streptococcal infection (HR: 2.5;
  CI:1.4-4.5; p <0.001), stroke as complication (HR: 1.98; CI:1.4-2.8; p <0.001) were
  independent risk factors of mortality.In terms of temporal trends the rate of combined
  NLIE decreased over time (14.5% to 5.1%, p = 0.03), while the rate of other types
  of IE did not changed. Regarding the type of underlying microorganism the rate of
  SA infection increased (17% to 41%, p = 0.002) and the rate of CoNS decreased (16.1%
  - 1.3% p < 0.001) over time. The 1-year mortality rate did not change through the
  years.During the observed 11 years 465 cases were administered with IE to our tertiary
  hospital, out of which two-third were NLIE. One-quarter of the underlying microorganism
  were streptococci, and the rate of Staphylococcus aureus infection was increased
  over time, which was associated with a worse prognosis. In addition IE had a high
  mortality, which unfortunately did not improve through the years.'
