 abstract = {It is well-known that obesity has a marked effect on many of the routinely used laboratory parameters. An obvious example is the serum level of various blood lipids: hyperlipidemia, hypercholesteremia are often observed in obese people. Our research aimed to provide a more thorough understanding of the effects of obesity on laboratory parameters, concentrating on every laboratory parameter, not just those that are already established as being related to obesity. We focused on adolescent population, as they are the most important from the public health point of view. To that end, we performed a cross-sectional clinical study that included the observation of n=148 male children (aged 12-16 year), consisting of healthy volunteers from four Hungarian secondary schools and obese patients treated with E66.9 “Obesity, unspecified” diagnosis (ICD-10). Observation included the recording of 27 laboratory parameter from a fasting blood sample. To explore this database, we performed a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (FA) to ease the understanding of correlations of the laboratory parameters by identifying those groups of variables that have stochastic connection. Such connections between laboratory parameters were further analyzed by agglomerative hierarchical clustering of the variables. These all confirmed that stochastically connected laboratory parameters – with different physiological interpretation – can be in fact identified.},
