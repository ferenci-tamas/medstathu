abstract: 'It is well-known that obesity has a marked effect on many of the routinely
  used laboratory parameters. An obvious example is the serum level of various blood
  lipids: hyperlipidemia, hypercholesteremia are often observed in obese people. Our
  research aimed to provide a more thorough understanding of the effects of obesity
  on laboratory parameters, concentrating on every laboratory parameter, not just
  those that are already established as being related to obesity. We focused on adolescent
  population, as they are the most important from the public health point of view.
  To that end, we performed a cross-sectional clinical study that included the observation
  of n=148 male children (aged 12-16 year), consisting of healthy volunteers from
  four Hungarian secondary schools and obese patients treated with E66.9 “Obesity,
  unspecified” diagnosis (ICD-10). Observation included the recording of 27 laboratory
  parameter from a fasting blood sample. To explore this database, we performed a
  Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (FA) to ease the understanding
  of correlations of the laboratory parameters by identifying those groups of variables
  that have stochastic connection. Such connections between laboratory parameters
  were further analyzed by agglomerative hierarchical clustering of the variables.
  These all confirmed that stochastically connected laboratory parameters – with different
  physiological interpretation – can be in fact identified.'
