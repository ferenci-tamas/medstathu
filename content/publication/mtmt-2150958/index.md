abstract: 'The current paper represents a continuation of the conference paper presented
  at the INES 2011 conference. It summarizes the updated results of research tasks
  in the field of physiological modeling and control of diseases with high public
  health impact carried out by the Biomedical Engineering Laboratory of the Budapest
  University of Technology and Economics. The developed and presented optimal algorithms
  and strategies focus on three cases: blood glucose control in case of the artificial
  pancreas problem, tight glycaemic control under intensive care and optimal antiangiogenic
  therapy in the treatment of cancerous tumor.'
