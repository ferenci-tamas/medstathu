abstract: This paper summarizes the results of research tasks in the field of physiological
  modeling and control of diseases with high public health impact carried out by the
  Biomedical Engineering Laboratory of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics.
  The developed and presented optimal algorithms and strategies focus on three diseases
  with high public health impact diabetes (the question of artificial pancreas), obesity
  (predicting obesity-related risks) and cancer (antiangiogenic chemotherapy). The
  studies are done together with different Hungarian hospitals, from where measurement
  data were obtained.
