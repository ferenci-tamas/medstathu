abstract: 'Background Liver disease has become an important cause of morbidity and
  mortality even in those HIV-infected individuals who are devoid of hepatitis virus
  co-infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the degree of hepatic fibrosis
  and the role of associated factors using liver stiffness measurement in HIV mono-infected
  patients without significant alcohol intake. Methods We performed a cross-sectional
  study of 101 HIV mono-infected patients recruited prospectively from March 1, 2014
  to October 30, 2014 at the Center for HIV, St István and St László Hospital, Budapest,
  Hungary. To determine hepatic fibrosis, liver stiffness was measured with transient
  elastography. Demographic, immunologic and other clinical parameters were collected
  to establish a multivariate model. Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) was performed
  to identify predictors of liver stiffness. Results Liver stiffness ranged from 3.0–34.3
  kPa, with a median value of 5.1 kPa (IQR 1.7). BMA provided a very high support
  for age (Posterior Effect Probability-PEP: 84.5%), moderate for BMI (PEP: 49.3%),
  CD4/8 ratio (PEP: 44.2%) and lipodystrophy (PEP: 44.0%). For all remaining variables,
  the model rather provides evidence against their effect. These results overall suggest
  that age and BMI have a positive association with LS, while CD4/8 ratio and lipodystrophy
  are negatively associated. Discussion Our findings shed light on the possible importance
  of ageing, overweight and HIV-induced immune dysregulation in the development of
  liver fibrosis in the HIV-infected population. Nonetheless, further controlled studies
  are warranted to clarify causal relations.'
