abstract: Although more and more data on lower limb amputations are becoming available
  by leveraging the widening access to health care administrative databases, the applicability
  of these data for public health decisions is still limited. Problems can be traced
  back to methodological issues, how data are generated and to conceptual issues,
  namely, how data are interpreted in a multidimensional environment. The present
  review summarised all of the steps from converting the claims data of administrative
  databases into the analytical data and reviewed the wide array of sources of potential
  biases in the analysis of such data. The origins of uncertainty of administrative
  data analysis include uncontrolled confounding due to a lack of clinical data, the
  left- and right-censored nature of data collection, the non-standardized diagnosis/procedure-based
  data extraction methods (i.e., numerator/denominator problems) and additional methodological
  problems associated with temporal and spatial analyses. The existence of these methodological
  challenges in the administrative data-based analysis should not deter the analysts
  from using these data as a powerful tool in the armamentarium of clinical research.
  However, it must be done with caution and a thorough understanding and respect of
  the methodological limitations. In addition to this requirement, there is a profound
  need for pursuing further research on methodology and widening the search for other
  indicators (structural, process or outcome) that allow a deeper insight how the
  quality of vascular care may be assessed. Effective research using administrative
  data is based on strong collaboration in three domains, namely expertise in claims
  data handling and processing, the clinical field, and statistical analysis. The
  final interpretations of results and the countermeasures on the level of vascular
  care ought to be grounded on the integrity of research, open discussions and institutionalized
  mechanisms of science arbitration and honest brokering.
