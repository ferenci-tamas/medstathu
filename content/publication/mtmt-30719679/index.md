abstract: 'The objective of the current study is to compare the relative performance
  of decision tree, neural network, and logistic regression for predicting 30-day
  and 1-year mortality in a real-word, unfiltered dataset (n = 47, 391) of patients
  hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) was
  used for evaluating performance of a learning algorithm. For 30-day mortality, we
  achieved an average of 0.788 for decision tree models, 0.837 for neural net models
  and 0.836 for regression models on training set (on validation sets: 0.774, 0.835
  and 0.834, respectively). For 1-year mortality, the averages were 0.754 for decision
  tree models, 0.8194 for neural net models and 0.8191 for regression models (on validation
  sets: 0.743, 0.8179 and 0.8176, respectively). Differences were non-significant
  between neural network and regression, but both significantly outperformed decision
  trees. The machine learning methods investigated in the present study could not
  outperform traditional regression modelling for mortality prediction in myocardial
  infarction. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.'
