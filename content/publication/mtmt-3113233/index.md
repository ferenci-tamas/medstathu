abstract: "Introduction: To the best of the authors' knowledge, very few publications\
  \ are available which report on the prognostic significance of the culprit vessel\
  \ in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction treated with successful primary\
  \ percutaneous coronary intervention. Aim: The aim of the authors was to obtain\
  \ data on the significance of the culprit vessel in patients with ST elevation myocardial\
  \ infarction treated successfully by primary percutaneous coronary intervention.\
  \ Method: The authors performed a retrospective study in 10,763 patients with ST\
  \ elevation myocardial infarction who underwent successful primary percutaneous\
  \ coronary intervention. The culprit vessels were the left main artery, left anterior\
  \ descendent artery, left circumflex artery, and right coronary artery. The authors\
  \ constructed univariate survival curves for different culprit vessels and also\
  \ performed multivariate modelling of time-to-death, controlling for age, sex, and\
  \ comorbidities. Results: The majority of the culprit lesions were found in the\
  \ left anterior descendent artery (44.3%), the right coronary artery (40.9%), and\
  \ the left circumflex artery (13.7%). The culprit vessel was overall a highly significant\
  \ (p<0.0001) factor of survival, with right coronary artery exhibiting a highly\
  \ significantly better prognosis (hazard ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.61-0.79, p<0.0001)\
  \ and left main artery exhibiting a significantly worse prognosis (hazard ratio\
  \ 1.56, 95% CI 1.04-2.35, p = 0.0321) than the reference vessel (left anterior descendent\
  \ artery). Conclusion: These data demonstrate that the culprit vessel has independent\
  \ prognostic significance."
