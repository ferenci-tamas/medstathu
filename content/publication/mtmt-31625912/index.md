abstract: Mathematical models of tumor growth in response to chemotherapy are crucial
  for therapy optimization and outcome. We create a relatively simple tumor growth
  model describing the antitumor effect of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) validated
  with real experimental data obtained in a genetically engineered mouse model of
  breast cancer. We use formal reaction kinetics to describe the pathophysiological
  phenomena using differential equations, and carry out parametric identification
  based on experiments using a mixed-effect model with stochastic approximation expectation
  maximization. The model gives a sufficient fit to describe tumor growth and pharmacokinetic
  data, and a satisfactory fit for the complex case, i.e., tumor response to chemotherapy.
  The results showed that identification of certain subsystems is easy using experimental
  data even if it is not specifically designed for identification. However, the identification
  of the complex pathophysiological phenomena may require experiments specially designed
  for identification purposes. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.
