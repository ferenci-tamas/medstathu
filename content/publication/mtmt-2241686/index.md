abstract: 'Obesity is a fast-growing endemic with an already alarmingly high prevalence
  and serious potential health consequences; both underlining its risk. Currently
  existing indicators of obesity and its risk are either easily computable, but of
  a smaller predictive value (e.g. BMI) or accurately predict risk, but are unfit
  for screening of wider populations (e.g. CT, DXA). 34 healthy Hungarian children
  (aged 14-16 years) were medically examined to collect parameters related to obesity:
  anthropometric parameters, body composition data provided by bioelectric impedance
  analysis, laboratory blood tests and medical history. Variables derived from prepared
  (factor analyzed, amongst others) anthropometric data and body composition were
  then clustered, revealing the presence of two distinct clusters. Sexes are fortunately
  independently distributed among clusters. Minuscule, but statistically significant
  differences in the laboratory tests were found between the clusters. These – especially
  the physiologically consistent ones – need further attention.'
