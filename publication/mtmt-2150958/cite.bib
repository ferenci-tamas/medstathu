 abstract = {The current paper represents a continuation of the conference paper presented at the INES 2011 conference. It summarizes the updated results of research tasks in the field of physiological modeling and control of diseases with high public health impact carried out by the Biomedical Engineering Laboratory of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. The developed and presented optimal algorithms and strategies focus on three cases: blood glucose control in case of the artificial pancreas problem, tight glycaemic control under intensive care and optimal antiangiogenic therapy in the treatment of cancerous tumor.},
