 abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The aim was to study the patients' adherence to some evidence-based medication (statins, beta blockers, platelet and RAS inhibitors) after suffering a myocardial infarction, and its impact on the outcome. METHOD: Retrospective observational cohort study was carried out from the data of the Hungarian Myocardial Infarction Registry between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2014. 14,843 patients were alive at the end of hospital treatment, from them, those who had no myocardial infarction or death until 180 days were followed for one year. The adherence was defined as the proportion of time from the index event to the endpoint (or censoring) covered with prescription fillings. The endpoint was defined as death or reinfarction. Information on filling prescriptions for statins, platelet aggregation inhibitors, beta blockers and ARB/ACEI-inhibitors were obtained. Multivariate regression was used to model adherence and survival time. RESULTS: Good adherence (\>80%) to clopidogrel, statins, beta blockers, aspirin and ARB/ACEI was found in 64.9%, 54.4%, 36.5%, 31.7% and 64.0%, respectively. Patients treated with PCI during the index hospitalization had higher adherence to all medication (all p<0.01), except for beta-blocker (p = 0.484). Multivariate analysis confirmed that adherence to statins, to clopidogrel and ARB/ACEI-inhibitors was associated with 10.1% (p<0.0001), 10.4% (p = 0.0002) and 15.8% (p<0.0001) lower hazard of endpoint respectively for 25% points increase in adherence, controlling for age, sex, performing of PCI, 5 anamnestic data and date of index event. Adherence to aspirin and beta blockers was not significantly associated with the hazard. CONCLUSION: Higher adherence to some evidence-based medications was found to be associated with improved long term prognosis of the patients. Orv Hetil. 2017; 158(27): 1051-1057.},
